## Installation instructions

These instructions assume that you have already a TAO installation on your system. If you don't, go to
[package/tao](https://github.com/oat-sa/package-tao) and follow the installation instructions.


Add the extension to your TAO composer and to the autoloader:
```bash
composer require oat-sa/extension-tao-offline
```

Install the extension on the CLI from the project root:

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo php tao/scripts/installExtension oat-sa/extension-tao-offline
```

**Windows:**
```bash
php tao\scripts\installExtension oat-sa/extension-tao-offline
```

As a system administrator you can also install it through the TAO Extension Manager:
- Settings (the gears on the right hand side of the menu) -> Extension manager
- Select _taoOffline_ on the right hand side, check the box and hit _install_

## Synchronization and Encryption

### Synchronization
The synchronization process is based upon two actors, the Client Server, which is installed on a Virtual Machine, and the Central Server.

#### Setting up the Client Server
The following script needs to be run on a TAO instance in order to create a Client Server:

```shell
sudo -u www-data php index.php '\oat\taoOffline\scripts\tools\setup\SetupClientServer'
```

On systems where [extension-tao-encryption](https://github.com/oat-sa/extension-tao-encryption) is installed, the script will set it up with encryption.
    
Point the instance to a specific server by executing the following command:
 
 ```shell
sudo -u www-data php index.php '\oat\taoSync\scripts\tool\RegisterHandShakeRootURL' --rootUrl=http://tao-central.dev/
 ```

#### Setting up the Central Server
Run the following to turn a TAO instance into a Central Server.

```shell
sudo -u www-data php index.php 'oat\taoOffline\scripts\tools\setup\SetupCentralServer'
```

Again, instances with `taoEncryption` will benefit from encryption.

#### Types of available synchronizations
* Central Server to VM
    * Test Centers
    * Users
    * Deliveries
    * Eligibilities
    * LTI Consumers
* VM to Central Server
    * Test Sessions
    * Results
    * Result Logs
    * LTI Users
    
#### Overview of the workflow

##### Sequence Diagram

#### Synchronizing users with encryption
Every user has been assigned an application key that is used to decrypt the delivery content. Properties that are excluded from the synchronization process can be found under `excludedProperties` in the configuration file `config/taoSync/syncService.conf.php`.  Properties that are encrypted are defined inside `config/taoEncryption/encryptUserSyncFormatter.conf.php`.

![Synchronizing users](docs/sync_users.png)

#### Synchronizing deliveries with encryption
During the synchronization of the deliveries, the test package is sent to the client. The client then imports the test and generates a delivery. 

_Note: If you are synchronizing a delivery that already exists on the VM a new import of the test will be created._

##### Synchronizing results with encryption
The `chunkSize` of a result is an essential configuration parameter that needs to be set in advance; the default is `10`. It can be set depending on the number of variables included in a result.

If you have, for example, a test with 100 items (which means about 400 variables), the total request will contain about 4000 variables. This scenario is likely to overload the server. In this case, reducing the `chunkSize` to a smaller value is advised.

The statuses of a result that needs to be sent can be configured under `statusExecutionsToSync` in `config/taoSync/resultService.conf.php`. Each request to the server will include the number of results. The process will stop after all results have been sent.

#### Synchronizing results - Logs
Each result log is synchronized with the Central Server to maintain a history of the test. The number of logs sent per request is defined in the configuration inside `config/taoSync/SyncDeliveryLogService.conf.php`.
